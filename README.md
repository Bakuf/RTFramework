# RT Framework

This is a framework I made for use with augmented reality, using OpenGLES 2.0. It is used to display content in 3d, for now there are only 4 types of contents that can be used :

 - Images
 - Sound (just a note image that can be paused with a touch)
 - Video
 - 3d Model (md2 format)

I used vuforia cloud recognizion service so it can be easily integrated in any project with vuforia just sending the model and projection matrix.

If there is no target you can rotate and zoom in and out the object, also you can mix any object.

Enjoy =)
